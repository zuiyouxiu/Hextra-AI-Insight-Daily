# Privacy Policy

*Last Updated: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! 👋 This Privacy Policy breaks down how we collect, use, and share your info when you're rocking our Service. We'll also fill you in on your privacy rights and how the law keeps things safe for you.

Your personal data? We use it to make our Service tick and get even better. By using our Service, you're essentially saying 'got it!' to us collecting and using your info as explained right here. Easy peasy.

## Jargon Busting & What It All Means

### The Lowdown
**Capitalized words**, you'll see them pop up, and they have special meanings defined below. Whether they're singular or plural, these definitions stay the same. Got it?

### Let's Define Some Stuff
For the sake of this Privacy Policy, here's what these terms mean:

- **Account** means the unique account created for you to get into our Service or parts of it. Think of it as your personal login!

- **Affiliate** means an entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with a party. Here, "control" means owning 50% or more of the shares, equity interest, or other securities that get to vote for directors or other managing bigwigs. 🤝

- **Company** (we call it "the Company," "we," "us," or "our" in this Agreement) means **hubtoday**. That's us!

- **Cookies** are just small files that a website drops onto your computer, mobile, or any other gadget. They store juicy details like your browsing history on that site, plus a bunch of other cool stuff. 🍪

- **Country** refers to: California, USA. Sunny Cali! ☀️

- **Device** means anything that can tap into our Service, like a computer, cell phone, or even a digital tablet. Your tech, basically.

- **Personal Data** is any info connected to a living, breathing, identified, or identifiable person. Pretty straightforward, right?

- **Service** means this Website. Simple as that.

- **Service Provider** means any natural or legal person who processes data on behalf of the Company. These are the awesome third-party companies or individuals we hire to help us run the Service, perform Service-related tasks, or help us figure out how the Service is being used. They're our behind-the-scenes helpers! 🦸‍♂️

- **Usage Data** is data automatically collected, generated either by using the Service or from the Service infrastructure itself. Think of it as the stats on how you're using things (like how long you chill on a page).

- **Website** means **hubtoday**, which you can hit up at `https://ai.hubtoday.app/`. Check it out! 👀

- **You** means the individual who's accessing or using the Service, or the company or other legal entity they're representing. Basically, it's YOU! 😉

## Getting & Using Your Personal Data

### The Kinds of Data We Scoop Up

#### Personal Data
When you're using our Service, we might ask you for some bits of info that can help us get in touch with you or figure out who you are. This 'personal data' could be things like, but not limited to:

- Email address
- Usage Data

#### Usage Data
**Usage Data** is the stuff that gets automatically collected when you're cruising through our Service. 🚗

This data might include your device’s Internet Protocol address (think of it as your IP address), what kind of browser you're using, its version, the pages you pop into on our Service, when and how long you visit, unique device IDs, and other diagnostic data. It’s all the techy bits and bobs!

When you hit up our Service on a mobile device, we might automatically grab some extra info. This includes, but isn't limited to, your mobile device type, its unique ID, IP address, operating system, the mobile internet browser you're rocking, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data. Pretty neat, huh?

And hey, whenever you visit our Service – whether on your computer or mobile – we might also collect info that your browser sends our way. Just FYI!

### Tracking Tech & Cookies 🍪
We use **Cookies** and other cool tracking technologies to keep an eye on activity within our Service and store certain bits of info. The tracking tech we roll with includes things like beacons, tags, and scripts. We use these to gather and track info, and generally make our Service better and help us analyze how you're using it. Some of the specific tech we might use includes:

- **Cookies or Browser Cookies**: A Cookie is just a tiny file popped onto your device. You can tell your browser to say "nope" to all Cookies or to give you a heads-up when one's being sent. But heads up: if you don't play along with Cookies, some parts of our Service might not work perfectly. Unless you've tweaked your browser settings to reject them, our Service will likely be using Cookies.
- **Web Beacons**: You might spot tiny electronic files called Web Beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) in some areas of our Service and our emails. These little guys help the Company (for example) count users who've visited those pages or opened an email. They also help with other website stats, like seeing how popular a section is or making sure our systems and servers are all good.

**Cookies** come in two flavors: "Persistent" or "Session" Cookies. Persistent Cookies stick around on your computer or mobile device even after you've gone offline. Session Cookies, on the other hand, vanish into thin air as soon as you close your web browser. Poof! 💨

We use both Session and Persistent Cookies for these awesome reasons:

- **Necessary / Essential Cookies**
  - **Type**: Session Cookies
  - **Managed by**: Us (The Company)
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are super important for giving you the services available through the Website and letting you use its cool features. They help us verify who you are and stop any shady business with user accounts. Without these Cookies, the services you've asked for simply wouldn't work, and we only use 'em for that. Seriously.

- **Cookies Policy / Acceptance Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Managed by**: Us (The Company)
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are basically our way of remembering if you've already given us the thumbs-up to use Cookies on the Website. So you don't get bugged constantly! 👍

- **Functionality Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Managed by**: Us (The Company)
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are pretty handy! They let us remember the choices you make when you're using the Website, like keeping track of your login deets or your language preferences. The whole point of these is to give you a more personalized experience, so you don't have to re-enter your preferences every single time you visit. Sweet! 😎

Want to know more about the Cookies we use and what choices you've got regarding them? Head over to our Cookies Policy or the Cookies section of our Privacy Policy. It's all there! 📖

### How We Use Your Personal Data
**The Company** might use your personal data for these cool purposes: 👇

- **To provide and maintain our Service**, including keeping an eye on how our Service is being used. Gotta make sure it's running smooth!
- **To manage your Account**: This involves managing your registration as a user of the Service. The personal data you provide helps you tap into different functionalities available only to our registered users. Pretty exclusive!
- **For Contract Performance**: This means getting things done for any purchase contract you've made for products, items, or services, or any other contract you've got with us through the Service. We gotta uphold our end of the deal! 🤝
- **To Contact You**: We might reach out via email, phone calls, SMS, or other electronic communication (like push notifications from a mobile app!) to give you updates or important info about features, products, or services you've signed up for – including those all-important security updates. Only when it's necessary or makes sense, of course!
- **To provide you with news**, special offers, and general info about other goods, services, and events we offer. This is usually stuff similar to what you've already bought or asked about, unless you've told us to chill out and not send you such info. Your call! 📣
- **To manage your requests**: We're on it! This covers handling and managing any requests you throw our way. We've got your back!
- **For Business Transfers**: We might use your info to evaluate or go through with a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or any other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets. This could be as a going concern or as part of a bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding. Basically, if the business changes hands, your personal data held by us about our Service users could be one of those transferred assets. Wild, right? 🎢
- **For Other Purposes**: Hey, we might also use your info for other cool stuff, like data analysis, spotting usage trends, figuring out how effective our promo campaigns are, and generally evaluating and making our Service, products, marketing, and your overall experience even better. Always improving! ✨

We might share your personal info in these situations: 👇

- **With Service Providers**: We may team up with Service Providers and share your personal info with them to monitor and analyze how our Service is being used, and to get in touch with you. They help us keep things running smoothly!
- **For Business Transfers**: If we're looking at a merger, selling off company assets, financing, or acquiring all or part of our biz by another company, we might share or transfer your personal info during or in negotiations for that whole shebang. It's all part of the game! 💼
- **With Affiliates**: We might share your info with our Affiliates. If we do, we'll make sure they promise to play by the rules of this Privacy Policy too. Our Affiliates include our parent company, any other subsidiaries, joint venture partners, or other companies we control or are under common control with. It's a family affair! 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
- **With Business Partners**: We could share your info with our business partners to hook you up with specific products, services, or cool promotions. Win-win! ✨
- **With Other Users**: If you're sharing personal info or interacting in the public areas with other users, remember that info might be seen by everyone and could even be publicly distributed outside. So, maybe don't spill all your secrets! 🤫
- **With Your Consent**: If you give us the green light, we can totally spill your personal info for any other purpose. It's all up to you! ✅

### Keeping Your Personal Data Around
**The Company** will only hold onto your personal data for as long as it's truly needed for the reasons explained in this Privacy Policy. We also keep and use your personal data to meet our legal duties (like when the law says we have to hold onto your data), sort out any disagreements, and enforce our legal agreements and policies. Basically, we're following the rules! ⚖️

**We** also keep Usage Data for our internal analytical fun. Usage Data usually hangs around for a shorter time. The only exceptions are if we need to use this data to boost our Service's security, make its functions even better, or if we're legally required to keep it longer. Perks of being data nerds! 📊

### Moving Your Personal Data Around
**Your info** (yep, that includes your personal data!) gets processed at the Company's operating offices and wherever else the parties involved in processing are located. This means your info could totally be sent to — and kept on — computers outside of your State, Province, Country, or other governmental jurisdiction. Just so you know, those places might have different data protection laws than yours.

By agreeing to this Privacy Policy and handing over your info, you're giving us the nod for this transfer. 👍

**The Company** will do everything reasonably necessary to make sure your data is treated securely and totally aligns with this Privacy Policy. We won't transfer your personal data to any organization or country unless we're super confident there are enough controls in place to keep your data and other personal info safe and sound. Your security is key! 🛡️

### Wiping Your Personal Data
You've got the right to erase, or ask us to help you erase, any personal data we've collected about you. It's your data, after all! 💪

**Our Service** might even let you delete certain bits of info about yourself right from inside the Service. How cool is that?

You can totally log into your Account (if you have one, of course!) anytime and hit up the account settings section where you can manage your personal info. From there, you can update, tweak, or delete your info. You can also just get in touch with us to ask for access, correction, or deletion of any personal info you've given us. We're here to help! 🙋‍♀️

Just a heads-up though: sometimes we might need to hang onto certain info if we've got a legal obligation or a legitimate reason. Rules are rules! 📜

### When We Might Spill Your Personal Data

#### Business Deals 🤝
**If the Company** gets involved in a merger, acquisition, or selling off assets, your personal data might get transferred. Don't worry, we'll give you a heads-up before your personal data gets moved and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy. Transparency is key! ✨

#### Law Enforcement 🚨
Sometimes, the Company might have to spill your personal data if the law requires it, or if a public authority (like a court or government agency) sends us a valid request. We gotta play by the book! 👮

#### Other Legal Stuff
**The Company** might also disclose your personal data if we genuinely believe such action is necessary to: 👇
- Play by the legal rules
- Protect and defend the Company's rights or property
- Prevent or investigate any possible mischief connected with the Service
- Keep Service users or the public safe
- Guard against legal liability

### Keeping Your Personal Data Safe & Sound
**The security of your personal data** is super important to us! Seriously. But hey, let's be real: no method of transmission over the Internet, or electronic storage, is 100% bulletproof. While we totally bust our butts to use commercially acceptable ways to protect your personal data, we just can't guarantee its absolute security. We're doing our best, though! 🤞

## Kids and Their Privacy (Under 13)
**Our Service** isn't aimed at anyone under the age of 13. Nope, not even a little bit! We totally don't knowingly collect any personally identifiable info from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you know your kiddo has given us personal data, please give us a shout. If we find out we've accidentally scooped up personal data from anyone under 13 without verified parental consent, we'll take steps to delete that info from our servers. Promise! 🙏

Now, if we need to lean on consent as the legal basis for processing your info, and your country requires parental consent, we might just ask for your parent's OK before collecting and using that info. Just making sure! ✅

## Links to Other Cool Spots (aka Websites!)
**Our Service** might have links to other websites that we don't actually operate. If you click on a third-party link, poof! You'll be whisked away to that third party's site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every single website you visit. Stay savvy! 🌐

**We** have zero control over, and take zero responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. Just a heads-up! 🙅‍♂️

## Whoa, Changes to This Privacy Policy?
**We** might update our Privacy Policy every now and then. When we do, we'll let you know about any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy right here on this page. Easy peasy!

Before the changes actually kick in, we'll give you a heads-up via email and/or a noticeable announcement on our Service. We'll also be sure to update that "Last Updated" date at the very top of this Privacy Policy. You'll be in the loop! 🔄

**We** totally recommend you check this Privacy Policy regularly to catch any changes. Any tweaks to this Privacy Policy become effective the moment they're posted on this page. So keep an eye out! 👀
