### Tracking Technologies and Cookies
We totally use Cookies and similar tracking technologies to keep tabs on activity on our Service and stash some info. These tracking tech tools include beacons, tags, and scripts, all working to collect and track info, plus improve and analyze our Service. The tech we might use includes:

- **Cookies or Browser Cookies**: A Cookie is a tiny file dropped onto your Device. You can totally tell your browser to refuse all Cookies or to give you a heads-up when one's being sent. But hey, if you don't accept Cookies, some parts of our Service might not work for you. Unless you've tweaked your browser settings to give Cookies the boot, our Service might just use them anyway. 🍪
- **Web Beacons**: Some parts of our Service and our emails might have these tiny electronic files called Web Beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs). These little guys let the Company (for example) count users who've visited those pages or opened an email, and they're used for other related website stats (like seeing how popular a certain section is and verifying system and server integrity). Pretty neat, right?

Cookies can be either "Persistent" or "Session" Cookies, FYI. Persistent Cookies stick around on your personal computer or mobile device even when you go offline, while Session Cookies vanish the moment you close your web browser. Poof! 💨

We're using both Session and Persistent Cookies for these purposes, check it:

- **Necessary / Essential Cookies**<br>- **Type**: Session Cookies<br>- **Administered by**: Us<br>- **Purpose**: These Cookies are absolutely crucial for hooking you up with services available through the Website and letting you use some of its cool features. They help authenticate users and stop any shady, fraudulent use of user accounts. Without these Cookies, the services you've asked for simply can't be provided, and we only use these Cookies to deliver those services to you. Simple as that.

- **Cookies Policy / Notice Acceptance Cookies**<br>- **Type**: Persistent Cookies<br>- **Administered by**: Us<br>- **Purpose**: These Cookies are all about checking if users have given the green light to the use of cookies on the Website. So, did you click 'Accept'? 🤔

- **Functionality Cookies**<br>- **Type**: Persistent Cookies<br>- **Administered by**: Us<br>- **Purpose**: These Cookies are super handy because they let us remember the choices you make when you use the Website, like recalling your login deets or language preferences. The whole point of these Cookies is to give you a more personalized experience and save you from having to re-enter your preferences every single time you use the Website. Sweet deal! ✨
