# Privacy Policy

*Last Updated: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! This Privacy Policy is all about how we handle your info when you use our Service. It covers what we collect, how we use it, and how we might spill the beans (but only when necessary!). Plus, we'll let you know your privacy rights and how the law's got your back. 🤫

We use your personal data to keep the Service running smoothly and make it even better for you. By using our Service, you're essentially saying 'Okay!' to us collecting and using your info as outlined in this Privacy Policy. 👍

## Let's Talk Definitions! 🧐

### Interpretations
You'll notice some words are capitalized. That's because they have specific meanings, which we're about to lay out below. These definitions stick, whether the words are singular or plural!

### Definitions
For the lowdown on this Privacy Policy:

- **Account** means that special, unique spot we've made for you to get into our Service, or specific bits of it.

- **Affiliate** is basically a company that controls, is controlled by, or hangs out with another company under shared control. "Control" here means owning 50% or more of the voting shares or stakes. Think of them as part of the same squad! 🤝

- **Company** (that's "the Company," "We," "Us," or "Our" in this whole document) means **hubtoday**. Yep, that's us! 👋

- **Cookies** are those tiny files websites stash on your computer, phone, or other gadget. They're pretty handy for remembering your browsing history on that site, among other things.

- **Country**? That's California, USA for us! 🇺🇸

- **Device** means pretty much anything you use to tap into our Service – your computer, phone, or tablet, for example.

- **Personal Data** is any info that can point back to you, an identified or identifiable individual. Keepin' it personal! 😉

- **Service**? That's just our fancy word for this Website you're on right now!

- **Service Provider** is anyone (a person or a company) who helps us handle data for the Company. Think of them as the awesome third-party pros we hire to make the Service happen, perform related tasks, or help us figure out how folks are using it.

- **Usage Data** is the info that gets automatically collected when you use our Service or from the Service's tech backbone itself – like how long you chilled on a certain page. 📊

- **Website** means **hubtoday**, which you can find right here: `https://ai.hubtoday.app/`.

- **You** means, well, *you*! The awesome individual using our Service, or if you're representing a company or other legal entity, that's you too.

## How We Collect and Use Your Personal Data 🕵️‍♀️

### What Kind of Data Do We Collect?

#### Personal Data
When you're hanging out with our Service, we might ask for some personal info that helps us get in touch or figure out who you are. This 'personally identifiable information' could be things like:

- Email address
- Usage Data

#### Usage Data
Usage Data? That's collected automatically when you're using the Service. No extra effort from you! 🚀

Usage Data might include stuff like your Device's Internet Protocol address (e.g., IP address), what kind of browser you're using (and its version), which pages on our Service you visited, when you visited them, how long you stayed, unique identifiers for your device, and other techy diagnostic bits.

If you're accessing the Service on your mobile device, we might automatically snag some information, including but not limited to, the type of mobile device you're rocking, your mobile device's unique ID, the IP address of your mobile device, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile Internet browser you're using, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic goodies.

We might also collect info your browser sends our way whenever you visit our Service or if you access the Service via a mobile device.

### Tracking Tech & Cookies: What's the Deal? 🍪
We're all about using Cookies and other cool tracking tech to keep an eye on what's happening on our Service and stash away some info. These tracking goodies – like beacons, tags, and scripts – help us gather data, improve things, and analyze how our Service is doing. The tech we use might be:

- **Cookies (or Browser Cookies, if you're fancy)**: These are tiny files that land on your Device. You totally have the power to tell your browser to reject all Cookies or give you a heads-up when one's trying to get sent. But here's the catch: if you ditch all Cookies, some parts of our Service might not work for you. Heads up, though, unless you've set your browser to give Cookies the cold shoulder, our Service might just use 'em.
- **Web Beacons**: Some parts of our Service and our emails might have these tiny electronic files called web beacons (also known as clear GIFs, pixel tags, or single-pixel GIFs). These help us do cool stuff like counting how many users checked out a page or opened an email, plus other website stats – like seeing how popular a section is or making sure our systems are all good to go.

So, Cookies come in two flavors: 'Persistent' and 'Session.' Persistent Cookies chill on your device even after you go offline, but Session Cookies vanish the moment you close your web browser. Poof! 💨

We use both types of Cookies – Session and Persistent – for these reasons:

-   **Necessary / Essential Cookies**
    -   **Type**: Session Cookies
    -   **Administered by**: Us
    -   **Purpose**: These Cookies are super important for giving you the services available through the Website and letting you use some of its cool features. They help authenticate users and prevent fraudulent use of user accounts. Without these Cookies, the services you've asked for simply can't be provided, and we only use these Cookies to deliver those services to you.

-   **Cookies Policy / Notice Acceptance Cookies**
    -   **Type**: Persistent Cookies
    -   **Administered by**: Us
    -   **Purpose**: These Cookies are used to figure out if users have given their 'okay' to the use of cookies on the Website.

-   **Functionality Cookies**
    -   **Type**: Persistent Cookies
    -   **Administered by**: Us
    -   **Purpose**: These Cookies let us remember the choices you make when you use the Website, like keeping track of your login deets or your language preference. The whole point of these Cookies is to give you a more personalized experience, so you don't have to re-enter your preferences every single time you use the Website.

Want more deets on the Cookies we use and what choices you have? Just swing by our Cookies Policy or the Cookies section in this very Privacy Policy. 📖

### How We Use Your Personal Data 🤔
The Company might use your Personal Data for these purposes:

-   **To keep our Service running smoothly and in tip-top shape**, which includes keeping an eye on how it's being used.
-   **To manage Your Account**: This is all about handling your registration as a user. The Personal Data You provide lets you unlock all the cool features available to registered users. ✨
-   **To fulfill a contract**: This means setting up, sticking to, and rocking any purchase contracts for products, items, or services you've bought, or any other agreements you've made with us through the Service.
-   **To get in touch with You**: We might reach out via email, phone calls, SMS, or other electronic messages (like push notifications from our mobile app). This is usually for updates or important info about features, products, or services you've signed up for – including security updates when they're super important. 📞
-   **To hook you up with news**: We love sharing news, special offers, and general info about other awesome goods, services, and events we've got going on that are similar to what you've already checked out. Of course, you can always opt-out if you're not into it.
-   **To handle Your requests**: We're here to process and manage any requests you send our way. Consider it done! ✅
-   **For business handovers**: Sometimes, businesses change hands! We might use your info to check out or go through with a merger, sale, restructuring, or any other transfer of our assets (even if it's a bankruptcy situation). In these cases, Personal Data held by us about our Service users might be one of those transferred assets.
-   **For other cool stuff**: We might also use your info for other purposes like digging into data, spotting usage trends, figuring out if our promos are hitting the mark, and generally boosting our Service, products, marketing, and your overall experience. Always striving for better! 📈

We might share your personal info in these situations:

-   **With Service Providers**: We might share Your personal information with Service Providers to help them monitor and analyze how our Service is being used, and to get in touch with You.
-   **For business handovers**: During talks or in connection with any merger, sale of Company assets, financing, or the acquisition of all or part of our business by another company, we might share or transfer your personal information.
-   **With Affiliates**: We might share Your info with Our affiliates. Don't worry, though, we'll make sure they play by the rules of this Privacy Policy too. Our Affiliates are essentially our parent company, any other subsidiaries, joint venture pals, or other companies that are under our control or controlled along with us.
-   **With business partners**: We might team up with our business partners and share your info to bring you certain products, services, or cool promotions. Win-win! 🎉
-   **With other users**: If you're sharing personal information or interacting in public spots with other users, just a heads-up: that info might be seen by everyone and could even be out there publicly. So share wisely! 🤫
-   **With Your blessing**: For any other reason, if you give us your explicit "go ahead," we might disclose your personal information. Your call! 👍

### How Long Do We Keep Your Personal Data? ⏳
The Company holds onto your Personal Data only for as long as we need it for the purposes explained in this Privacy Policy. We'll keep and use your Personal Data as much as required to meet our legal obligations (like if we gotta hold onto data for certain laws), sort out any disagreements, and enforce our legal agreements and policies. Fair enough, right?

The Company also keeps Usage Data for our own internal analysis. Generally, Usage Data sticks around for a shorter time, unless we're using it to beef up the security of our Service, improve its features, or if we're legally required to keep it for a longer stretch.

### Where Does Your Personal Data Travel? 🌍
Your info (yep, including your Personal Data) gets processed at the Company's main offices and wherever else our processing partners are chilling. This means your information may jet off to and be stored on computers located outside of Your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction – places where the data protection laws might be a bit different from what you're used to.

By saying 'yes' to this Privacy Policy and sending over your info, you're giving us the green light for that transfer. Got it? 😉

The Company is committed to taking all reasonable steps to make sure your data is handled securely and according to this Privacy Policy. We won't send your Personal Data to any organization or country unless we're sure they have solid controls in place, especially when it comes to keeping your data and other personal info safe and sound. Your security is our priority! 🔒

### Want to Delete Your Personal Data? No Problem! 🗑️
You totally have the right to delete, or ask for our help in deleting, any Personal Data we've collected about you.

Our Service might even let you delete some of your info right there from inside the Service itself. How convenient is that? ✨

You can update, change, or zap your information anytime by logging into Your Account (if you've got one) and heading to the account settings section that allows You to manage Your personal information. Or, just hit us up! You can ask us to access, correct, or delete any personal information you've given us.

Just a heads-up, though: we might need to hang onto certain information if we have a legal obligation or a valid reason to do so. Some things just gotta stay! 😉

### When We Might Disclose Your Personal Data 📢

#### Business Dealings 🤝
If the Company ever gets into a merger, acquisition, or sells off assets, your Personal Data might get transferred. We'll definitely give you a heads-up before your Personal Data moves and falls under a different Privacy Policy.

#### Law Enforcement 🚨
Sometimes, the Company might have to spill the beans on your Personal Data if the law demands it, or if a public authority (like a court or government agency) makes a valid request. We gotta play by the rules!

#### Other Legal Stuff
The Company might also disclose your Personal Data if we genuinely believe it's necessary to:

-   Comply with a legal obligation
-   Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company
-   Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service
-   Protect the personal safety of Users of the Service or the public
-   Protect against legal liability

### Keeping Your Personal Data Safe & Sound 🛡️
Keeping your Personal Data secure is super important to us. But let's be real: no method of sending data over the Internet, or storing it electronically, is ever 100% bulletproof. While we hustle to use top-notch, commercially acceptable ways to protect your Personal Data, we just can't promise absolute security. It's a tricky world out there! 😬

## What About the Kids' Privacy? 👧👦
Our Service isn't for anyone under 13. Period. We absolutely do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you find out your child has shared Personal Data with us, please, please get in touch. If we discover we've accidentally collected Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verification of parental consent, we'll quickly swoop in and remove that information from our servers. Promise! 🛡️

And if we need parental consent as a legal reason to process your information (and your country requires it), we might ask for your parent's 'okay' before we collect and use that data.

## Heads Up: Links to Other Websites! 🔗
Our Service might have links to other websites that aren't run by us. If you click on one of those third-party links, you'll be whisked away to their site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every single site you visit. Better safe than sorry! 😉

Just know, we have zero control over, and take zero responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. They're on their own! 🤷‍♀️

## Updates to This Privacy Policy (and How We'll Tell You) 📣
We might tweak our Privacy Policy now and then (it happens!). When we do, we'll let you know about any changes by simply posting the shiny new Privacy Policy right here on this page.

Before any big changes go live, we'll make sure to give you a heads-up via email and/or a noticeable announcement on our Service. We'll also update that "Last Updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. So you'll always be in the loop! 🗓️

It's a good idea to peek at this Privacy Policy periodically to catch any changes. Any updates to this Privacy Policy become effective the moment we post them right here on this page.
