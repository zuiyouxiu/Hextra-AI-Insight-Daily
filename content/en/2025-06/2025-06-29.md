7.  ⚠️ **wwwgoubuli** just dropped a major hot take: it's a bad idea to use super long prompts with tons of rules because you're bound to miss instructions. 🤔 He reckons the better strategy is to go **layered**, use **multi-agent processing**, and let each agent do its own thing, instead of just blindly copying models (like Claude) that dump all instructions into one massive prompt. Seriously, that's some real wisdom right there! More details: `['https://x.com/wwwgoubuli/status/1938647120812356008'](https://x.com/wwwgoubuli/status/1938647120812356008)`
