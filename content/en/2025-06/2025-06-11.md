2.  **EvoSearch (Evolutionary Search) technology**, jointly released by research teams from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and Kuaishou Technology, is basically a fresh breeze blowing through the AI art scene! 🌬️ This tech totally flips the script on the whole "bigger model, bigger compute" mindset, cleverly baking Darwin's evolutionary theory into the AI generation process. The result? It's letting those "little guy" models crank out high-quality images and videos that actually outperform or rival the "big guns"! This breakthrough is set to kick off an "intelligent evolution" era for AI creation, letting AI models unlock deeper potential during the inference stage. Peep the project homepage, code, and paper links here: [https://tinnerhrhe.github.io/evosearch/](https://tinnerhrhe.github.io/evosearch/)、[https://github.com/tinnerhrhe/EvoSearch-codes](https://github.com/tinnerhrhe/EvoSearch-codes)、[https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17618).

3.  **Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)** can seriously level up their cross-domain multimodal reasoning skills by playing simple arcade games, even outperforming specialized models trained on specific data! 🤯 This mind-blowing discovery was revealed in an academic paper titled "**Generalization Through Play: Learning to Reason with Games**." It definitely points to a super fun new path for cultivating future general AI capabilities, letting AI get smarter through play. Game on! 🎮

4.  The new paper "**Dreamland**" is shaking things up, proposing a hybrid framework that marries physical simulators with large generative models. Its mission? To cook up highly controllable and super realistic dynamic virtual worlds. This isn't just about massively boosting image quality and controllability; more importantly, it's poised to offer the perfect training ground and 'lab' for **embodied AI agents**, helping AI learn and rock it in the real world! 🌍

### **AI Industry Outlook & Social Impact**
1.  **Li Auto** recently underwent a major shake-up in its organizational structure, officially establishing two brand-new second-level departments: "**Space Robot**" and "**Wearable Robot**." This isn't just a departmental reshuffle; it signals that Li Auto is leveling up from a traditional car manufacturer to a full-blown **smart mobility ecosystem builder**. Their goal is to use robotics to build a complete smart living service system that covers both the in-car "third space" experience and smart wearable devices outside the vehicle. This move will definitely give Li Auto a fresh edge in the fiercely competitive market, turning that "third space" strategy into a total reality! 🚗🤖
2.  **Ohio State University** just dropped a bombshell, announcing that starting this year, all students will be *required* to undergo **Artificial Intelligence (AI) training**! This is basically a mandatory skill set for crushing it in the future workplace! 🎓 The university launched its "**AI Fluency**" program, fully integrating AI education into undergraduate courses, designed to equip students with the chops to effectively blend their professional knowledge with AI tech. Of course, the school also made it clear that students shouldn't use generative AI to 'cheat the system,' and they're beefing up teacher training to maintain **academic integrity**. This whole move aims to ensure every grad can effectively apply AI in their field, and it totally backs the Ohio AI Education Coalition's push for AI education in K-12, making AI everyone's ultimate sidekick. 🤖

3.  Renowned thinker **Li Jigang** hit the nail on the head when he said that as AI tech gets more and more efficient and powerful, human judgment, taste, and grasp of purpose actually become *more* crucial and 'hardcore.' Why? Because while AI can whip up a million solutions and execute them perfectly, it can't step in for humans when it comes to making choices, defining beauty, or understanding complex, deep human nature. This just hammers home the point that in the AI era, the real gold might just be those human-only skills. 🤔

4.  User **wwwgoubuli** spilled the tea on a cool shift in how his team uses AI at work. He mentioned that remote team members initially held back from fully using AI, worried they'd look lazy. But after he kept dropping tips on the 'right way' to use AI, the team slowly started going all in. The result? Code comments, standards, and overall quality all shot up significantly, and folks even seemed more confident! 💪 This is a prime example of AI empowering team efficiency, totally busting through that internal 'AI anxiety.' 🥳
