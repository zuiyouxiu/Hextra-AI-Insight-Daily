### Cutting-Edge AI Research
1.  **MMSearch-R1** is a groundbreaking **end-to-end reinforcement learning framework** designed to empower **multimodal large models (LMMs)** to perform multi-turn searches on the actual internet, based on user needs. It brilliantly integrates both image and text search tools for super efficient problem-solving! This model totally crushes it in **knowledge-intensive** and **information query VQA tasks**. Not only does it outperform **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** baseline models of similar scale, but it can even match the performance of much larger RAG models while using over 30% fewer search calls. How cool is that?! ['Paper Address'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20670)

### AI Industry Outlook & Social Impact
1.  **XBOW**, an AI security company, just made history! 🛡️ With its homegrown AI tool, also named "**XBOW**," it has for the first time surpassed human researchers, snatching the #1 spot on the U.S. leaderboard of **HackerOne**, the globally renowned **vulnerability crowdsourcing platform**! This is a massive milestone for AI in the **vulnerability detection** game. This **fully automated penetration testing system** has already submitted nearly 1060 vulnerabilities on HackerOne and just snagged a sweet $75 million in Series B funding. This totally signals that AI is about to reshape the **cybersecurity** landscape, accelerating how we find and fix bugs.

2.  Hold up, **large models** are absolutely slaying the Gaokao! 🎓 Recently, ByteDance's Seed team benchmarked five mainstream **large models**, including **Doubao Seed 1.6-Thinking** and **Gemini 2.5 Pro**, against the full 2025 **Shandong Gaokao exam** (closed-book!). And get this: Doubao snagged first place in Liberal Arts (683 points), while Gemini crushed it in Science (655 points). Their overall scores are now good enough to aim for Tsinghua and Peking University, or at least guarantee a spot in a 985-level university! In just one year, these large models have boosted their Gaokao scores by over a hundred points, showcasing some serious **text understanding**, **multimodal comprehension**, and **reasoning capabilities** 🚀. This proves the Gaokao is no longer a real "intelligence" test for them. Moving forward, these models should dive deeper into areas like **scientific research** and **artistic creation** – their potential is limitless! ✨ ['More Details'](https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2025-06-26-12)

4.  Okay, big news from blogger "Xiaohu": **Microsoft** is reportedly hinting they're giving up on talks with **OpenAI** about its transition to a for-profit company and IPO. ⚔️ The reason? The two just couldn't agree on terms. 🤔 **OpenAI** apparently wants to terminate Microsoft's existing rights to model **intellectual property** and its 20% **revenue share**. But their new offer didn't get a nod from Microsoft. There's even talk that this whole thing could push **OpenAI** to pull the "nuclear option" of alleging **anti-competitive behavior**! 💥 ['More Details'](https://x.com/imxiaohu/status/1938130680636182595).

5.  Meng Shao just shared Andrej Karpathy's unique take: when it comes to AI applications, we should totally be focusing on "**context engineering**" 🧠💡, not just plain old "**prompt engineering**." Why? Because "context engineering" involves meticulously designing the **information window**, optimizing **information quantity**, and **content structure** – way more complex than just typing in a few prompts! ✨ Karpathy also debunked the myth that AI applications are merely "**ChatGPT wrappers**." He stressed that actual development covers a whole complex spectrum of steps like problem decomposition, model selection, UI management, and security protection. Seriously, it's no joke! 💪 ['More Details'](https://x.com/shao__meng/status/1938120617494253712).
6.  Blogger wwwgoubuli has a wild prediction: AI is gonna usher in an era of "**fact-generating lightweight applications**" 🔮🚀! Users will truly be able to achieve "what you say is what you get," instantly spinning up and tearing down all sorts of apps, while the marketing and promotion value of traditional large software will seriously tank. He believes this is all thanks to the widespread adoption of **high-speed inference technology** and breakthrough experiences from models like **Google Gemini**. He forecasts that in the future, AI will become **infrastructure** just like electricity, water, and gas, but many applications themselves will become invisible and priceless, potentially even leading to a monopoly on the "**magic world entrance**" 🌌.
