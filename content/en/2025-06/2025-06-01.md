4.  **Quark** recently **rolled out its 'Deep Research' feature** – and it's a game-changer! 🤩 Powered by the **Tongyi Qianwen large model**, this bad boy can automatically handle the entire research process, from gathering data to **generating full reports**, for complex topics like academic subjects or industry analysis. This move clearly marks **AI's** leap from just an **information retrieval tool** to a full-fledged **content creation partner**, offering **highly efficient support** for everything from scientific research to market insights. Pretty neat, right?

5.  **Alibaba Cloud** officially **launched Tongyi Lingma AI IDE** – and developers, get ready to speed up your workflow! 🚀 This native AI development environment seriously boosts developer **programming efficiency** with its super powerful **programming agent mode**, **long-term memory**, and **inline suggestion prediction** features. Best part? It's already **free to download**, and its plugins have already generated over 3 billion lines of code, making it a wildly popular programming assistant that offers **strong support** for enterprise development work. Sweet! 😎

6.  **Memvid** is seriously an **innovative AI memory tool** that's changing the game! 🤯 By **encoding text data into MP4 videos**, it pulls off **sub-second rapid semantic search**, saves tons of storage space, and even works offline. It's got a **built-in chat function** and supports **PDF document import**, opening up a whole new revolutionary world of **possibilities** for **efficient knowledge management** and **academic research**. You gotta **learn more** [here](https://github.com/Olow304/memvid)! ✨

7.  Get this: **Dario Amodei, Anthropic's CEO**, just **warned** that **AI** could potentially **replace half of all entry-level white-collar jobs** within the next five years! 😱 This could send **unemployment rates soaring** to 10-20% and totally worsen **economic inequality**. He's calling for the public to boost their **awareness** and **AI literacy** about AI development so folks can adapt to the future job market. Plus, he stressed that policymakers gotta start thinking about **solutions** for a super intelligent economy. Heavy stuff!

8.  AI startup **Manus** just **unleashed its killer Manus Slides feature** – and it's a game-changer for presentations! 🤩 Users can now **generate professional slides with just one prompt** for various scenarios like business meetings or educational courses, seriously **boosting presentation creation efficiency**. Thanks to its **smart generation** and **flexible editing** capabilities, this feature supports exporting to PowerPoint or PDF. It totally signals how **AI agents** are evolving from mere task automation to full-blown **productivity tools**. Talk about making life easier! ✨

9.  **prompt-eng-interactive-tutorial**, rocking **7086 stars** on GitHub, is Anthropic's open-source project for an **interactive prompt engineering tutorial**. It's designed to help you **learn prompt engineering in a fun and effective way**. Go check it out and **learn more** [here](https://github.com/anthropics/prompt-eng-interactive-tutorial)! 🚀

10. The **onlook** project, which has **racked up 10143 stars** on GitHub, is an **open-source visual ambiance code editor** that uses **AI** to help designers and developers **visually build**, **beautify**, and **edit React applications**. This tool acts like a designer's **cursor**, making **React development** way more **intuitive and efficient**. Seriously, you gotta **learn more** [here](https://github.com/onlook-dev/onlook)! ✨

11. The **anthropic-cookbook** project, boasting a whopping **12755 stars**, is Anthropic's collection of **notebooks/recipes** that **showcase how to use Claude in fun and effective ways**.
