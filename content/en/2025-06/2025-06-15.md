### **AI Product & Feature Updates**
1. **Quark**'s large model absolutely crushed it in the post-2025 Gaokao AI math practical test, scoring an impressive 145 and 146 points! 🚀 It zoomed past rivals like Doubao and Yuanbao, setting a new benchmark for domestic **AI math capabilities**. Not only did Quark show astonishing accuracy, but its response speed was also miles ahead, unleashing a new era of heuristic learning for users with its powerful **science problem-solving skills**. <br/> ![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justlovemaki/imagehub/refs/heads/main/images/2025/07/news_01k024hz2desparrd3407y87rc.avif) <br/>

### **AI Frontier Research**
1. **Claude Opus** just dropped a mic! 🎤🔥 A spicy tweet from orange.ai revealed someone directly "authored" a short article titled 'The Illusion of the Illusion of Thinking' *under Claude Opus's name* as the first author. This was a direct, sassy rebuttal to Apple's paper, 'The Illusion of Thinking,' which questioned large models' reasoning abilities, and it also threw some shade at **Apple's AI research level**. This move not only hints at **Claude Opus**'s immense power in the AI field but also sparked a philosophical debate about the true **essence of thinking** in large models.

2. **Anthropic (Claude)** and **Cognition (Devin)** are duking it out over the pros and cons of **multi-agent systems**, and orange.ai spilled the tea! 🥊 Claude is all-in on **collective intelligence**, arguing that multi-agents, with their diversity, can break through single-agent context bottlenecks and boost performance by over 90%. But Devin threw some cold water, warning that multi-agent systems might lead to **context** inconsistency, information fragmentation, and communication breakdowns. This debate is like a mirror, reflecting how complex **AI architecture design** is – it's like managing a huge company! Plus, it might just hint that after the **Scaling Law** cools down, the **collective intelligence** formed by **multi-agents** could be the key "seed" to spark exponential growth in AI.

### **AI Industry Outlook & Social Impact**
1. **Gartner** just dropped a bold prediction: by 2028, a whopping 80% of **generative AI business applications** will be birthed directly on existing data management platforms! 🚀 This is basically hitting the "accelerate" button for developers, expected to halve project delivery times and slash development difficulty. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** technology is highlighted as the core weapon here, making AI models more accurate and reliable. It can also mash up with a company's latest data, injecting serious power into process optimization, user experience boosts, and future insights forecasting. <br/> ![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justlovemaki/imagehub/refs/heads/main/images/2025/07/news_01k024j6h7fadbwf7888j7zvc7.avif) <br/>
2. **Match Group**'s latest research has unearthed a super intriguing trend: **AI companions** are quietly becoming people's **new emotional choice**! 🤔 The survey found that 16% of respondents even see robots as "romantic partners." Even crazier, a whopping 60% don't consider a partner having an AI girlfriend or boyfriend as **cheating**, which totally shakes up our traditional definitions of intimate relationships. But hey, while AI companions can offer emotional comfort, experts are also flagging potential risks, like possibly worsening **social isolation** and stirring up privacy and **ethical issues**. This definitely makes us ponder deeply how technology and human emotions will intertwine in the future. <br/> ![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justlovemaki/imagehub/refs/heads/main/images/2025/07/news_01k024jb8feavtye1sstcj224t.avif) <br/>
3. **Liko** can't stop gushing about how **Cursor** and **Claude code** are these god-tier tools that are totally revolutionizing traditional **engineering development methods**! 🤯 He pointed out that small teams, thanks to agile collaboration with **AI Agents**, are so efficient they're leaving big companies' rigid processes in the dust. This insane acceleration in **AI tools**' iterative capabilities is crystal clear from events like Lovable and the lightning-fast product development of the Cursor/Claude teams themselves. It signals that future innovation will explode at speeds you can't even imagine, maybe even giving us "workers" a shocking feeling of "nothing left to do."

### **Open Source TOP Projects**
1. **Tencent's Hunyuan 3D 2.1 Large Model** officially went **open-source**, announced with a bang at CVPR 2025! ✨ As the first full-link **industrial-grade 3D generation** large model, it's made huge breakthroughs in 3D effects and material rendering. Even better, it even supports deployment on **consumer-grade graphics cards**, drastically lowering the barrier for general users and developers in **3D content creation**. This model offers efficient solutions for industries like gaming and film, and with over 1.8 million cumulative downloads on Hugging Face, its sky-high popularity among global developers is undeniable.

### **Social Media Shares**
1. **Twitter user wwwgoubuli** spilled the beans on his "advanced" **AI chatting** experience, discovering that AI is totally a master at spitting out **correct and complex long sentences**, which gives him a unique reading pleasure. 🤓 He jokingly pointed out that while we usually stick to short sentences in daily chats, it's only when talking with AI that you can really dive deep into that rich, **semantically dense experience** built by those long sentences. ['More Details'](https://x.com/wwwgoubuli/status/1933814617052225790)
2. **Ginobefun** genuinely shared some "top-secret" goodness: a goldmine of **curated AI RSS feeds** he spent a whole day meticulously putting together! 💎 This treasure trove includes over 200 tech articles, 30+ AI podcasts, and 150+ core AI users on Twitter – seriously, it's like a martial arts manual for keeping up with cutting-edge AI trends! He especially recommends using **@follow_app_** to import these resources, raving about its **AI summarization, translation**, and recent reader features that massively boost the user experience. ['Project Link'](https://github.com/ginobefun/BestBlogs) <br/> ![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justlovemaki/imagehub/refs/heads/main/images/2025/07/news_01k024jk4ff8z9trrfrgj26bkj.avif) <br/>
3. **Li Jigang** dropped some unique insights on **how to use AI** on social media. 🤝 He pointed out that both the initial "I'm the boss" mode, or the "**human fiercer than AI**" approach (human-centric), and the current mistaken "AI is the big bro" or "**AI as master, I as servant**" mode (vibe coding) have their limits. Now, he firmly believes that only **"human-AI collaborative co-creation"** can truly **unlock AI's potential** and let the tech deliver maximum value.
