## AI Insight Daily Scoop: June 20, 2025 🚀

### **Fresh AI Product & Feature Drops**
1.  OpenAI just dropped a cool new feature for its macOS desktop app: "**ChatGPT Record**" 🎙️. This bad boy is designed specifically for **Pro, Team, Enterprise, and Edu users**, offering up to 120 minutes of **real-time recording, transcription, and summarization**. What's super important? OpenAI emphasizes that recordings are automatically deleted after use and **will NOT be used for model training**, clearly aiming to seriously boost user productivity for meetings, interviews, and the like.
2.  YouTube's CEO, Neal Mohan, just spilled the beans: **YouTube Shorts** is getting a major upgrade later this summer with the **Veo3 AI video generation model**! This model is set to seriously level up short video quality and will even integrate audio elements, empowering creators even more. BTW, **YouTube Shorts** is already pulling in over **200 billion daily views** 🤯. The big question though? It's still TBD whether using Veo3 will cost extra dough. <br/> ![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justlovemaki/imagehub/refs/heads/main/images/2025/07/news_01k024920xehjsw6n206n93p02.avif) <br/>
3.  **Midjourney**, the powerhouse in AI image generation, just dropped its first-ever **video generation model**! This new tech can magically turn **static images into short 2-4 second animated clips** ✨. This is a huge leap for the company as it moves towards a **real-time 3D world simulation system**, and it's definitely gonna push the boundaries of **AI video generation tech** even further.
4.  Google's got big plans for its Search Live mode, part of its AI Mode search function! Over the next few months, it's getting a major upgrade with **real-time camera interaction** and **personalized search experiences**, aiming to transform it into a smarter, more interactive **all-in-one AI assistant**. This mode already rolled out to Google Labs users in the U.S. on June 18th, supporting **two-way voice conversations** and **multi-tasking**. However, it still faces some hurdles, especially with global expansion, **privacy management**, and its impact on the **content ecosystem** 🤔. <br/> <video src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justlovemaki/imagehub/refs/heads/main/images/2025/07/news_01k0249enze1crr4gfkp6a7y44.mp4" controls="controls" width="100%"></video> <br/> <br/> ![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justlovemaki/imagehub/refs/heads/main/images/2025/07/news_01k0249k21fryr93vd2zwrfr0t.avif) <br/>
5.  MiniMax just unveiled its brand-new **MiniMax Agent** 🤖, a general-purpose intelligent agent designed to tackle **complex, long-term tasks** like a champ! This clever agent automatically plans and executes tasks by deeply understanding user needs, essentially positioning AI as your "reliable teammate." What's it packed with? Core features include **programming and tool utilization**, **multimodal understanding and generation**, and **seamless MCP integration**. This is expected to totally reshape the productivity tool landscape and push various industries deeper into the intelligent era. <br/> ![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justlovemaki/imagehub/refs/heads/main/images/2025/07/news_01k0249p5ef6stcp9qsavc6s9b.avif) <br/> <br/> <video src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justlovemaki/imagehub/refs/heads/main/images/2025/07/news_01k024agdpf38am484vw2j79e9.mp4" controls="controls" width="100%"></video> <br/>
6.  Guizang.ai (guizang.ai) just spilled the tea ☕️ on their test drive and release deets for **Midjourney Video Model V1**! This model comes with low/high dynamic range options and extended features. The subscription is a cool $10 a month, but video tasks are priced at about 8 times that of image tasks, generating four 5-second videos per go. Guizang.ai totally lauded **Midjourney** for sticking to its core strengths and not jumping into the me-too competition. <video src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justlovemaki/imagehub/refs/heads/main/images/2025/07/news_01k024b6a3ewwajstjq9hgz1vr.mp4" controls="controls" width="100%"></video> [More Details](https://x.com/op7418/status/1935518217784672295)
