3.  **Baoyu** hit us with a super profound point: In the **AI era**, technical **depth** trumps **breadth**! 🤔🧠 Why? Because AI can fill gaps in breadth, but it can't fix a lack of depth. He emphasized that **experts in specialized fields** can still churn out high-quality results even with AI's help, while those who are jack-of-all-trades but master of none will struggle to hit excellence. This really sheds light on AI's true nature as an enabler for **specialized skills**, not a total replacement. Food for thought, right?!

4.  **Baoyu** also brought up a heated debate about **AI code generation quality**! 💻💸 He pointed out that for big projects, the code quality from **Claude Code** just doesn't stack up against the more expensive **Cline + Gemini 2.5 Pro**, and **Claude Code** also needs more human intervention. This doesn't just show the pretty significant differences in code generation capabilities across various **AI models**; it also spills the tea on the potentially **steep costs** of chasing **high-quality AI-assisted programming**. Talk about a love-hate tightrope walk, huh?!
