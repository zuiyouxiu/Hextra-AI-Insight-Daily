### **AI Content Summary**

WeChat Pay's MCP feature is boosting AI commercialization, and Meta is testing proactive chatbots.
New open-source AI models are enhancing performance, while power companies warn that AI power consumption threatens global stability.
ByteDance and MiniMax are open-sourcing multiple AI tools, exploring new modes of AI collaboration.

### **AI Product and Feature Updates**

1.  **WeChat Pay** recently rolled out its innovative **MCP feature**, which is like a superhighway for AI application commercialization! 😎 This cool new function lets AI handle payments directly during user interactions, seriously simplifying payment processes and boosting conversion rates. What's even smarter is how it creates a data loop, allowing AI to tweak services in real-time and even turn revenue into a data source, pushing AI business models towards **self-learning** and wider scenario expansion. Talk about hitting multiple birds with one stone!

2.  **Meta** is quietly testing a "more proactive" **chatbot** within its popular apps **Facebook Messenger** and **WhatsApp**. These bots are pretty slick, remembering your preferences and even striking up conversations! While this move could deepen user interaction with AI and generate substantial revenue, folks should also remember that potential **security risks** definitely need a heads-up! 😬

### **AI Frontier Research**

1.  German AI consulting firm **TNG** has unleashed a seriously "wild" AI model called **DeepSeek R1T2 Chimera**! This bad boy cleverly blends three major models—DeepSeek V3, R1, and R1-0528—and uses a super cool "**Agent of Experts (AoE) technology**." Get this: it's even faster and more powerful than the official R1! This **open-source model**, with weights available on Hugging Face, is set to find the **optimal balance** between speed, intelligence, and output efficiency. So much to look forward to! 🚀 For more deets, check out the ['Model Address'](https://huggingface.co/tngtech/DeepSeek-TNG-R1T2-Chimera) and ['Paper Address'](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14794).

### **AI Industry Outlook and Social Impact**

1.  The CEO of **Hitachi Energy**, the world's largest transformer manufacturer, has sounded the alarm! 🚨 They're warning that the roller-coaster-like power demands from AI data centers could seriously jeopardize global power supply stability. This CEO is strongly urging governments to quickly step in and limit these fluctuations. The International Energy Agency also predicts data center power consumption will double by 2030! To tackle transformer shortages and keep the grid stable, Hitachi Energy plans to pump $6 billion into operations and hire 15,000 new employees to boost production. Talk about a massive undertaking!

2.  **Guizang.ai** (歸藏) shared a super interesting new feature from **Dia Browser**: **History Summary**! Users can regularly have AI analyze their past week's browsing data—it can even "peek" at your secret video watch history. This clearly shows that AI's application in personal data analysis is getting deeper and more personalized. It feels like AI is getting to know us better and better, doesn't it?! 🤔 ['More Details'](https://x.com/op7418/status/1940997705779892617)

3.  **Wwwgoubuli** shared an innovative way to **deeply collaborate with AI**: instead of directly asking AI for answers, he first gets AI to help him sort out and refine his verbally unclear or messy questions. 💡 This "let AI organize the questions" approach not only provides better context for subsequent real answers but, what's even more magical, users can often find the answers to their own dilemmas during the refining process! Talk about brilliant! ['More Details'](https://x.com/wwwgoubuli/status/1940974712055910818)

4.  **Tom Huang** laid out the exciting future of **Refly AI's creative canvas**! 🚀 He envisions that if future versions can integrate **multimodal generation capabilities** (like image, video, and audio generation) and combine them with multimodal understanding models like **Gemini**, it will massively enrich content creation and help build even more captivating stories! This definitely signals the huge potential for AI creation tools in multimodal integration. The future's looking super bright! ['More Details'](https://x.com/tuturetom/status/1940943363898834947)

5.  Responding to Wang Shuyi's query, **@wwwgoubuli** sharply called out certain "teachers" in the current AI coding space for spouting off nonsense. 🔥 He reckons that **senior programmers** who genuinely use **AI programming** extensively wouldn't come to similar conclusions—they'd probably scoff at even commenting. This statement really highlights the extreme importance of **practical experience** in understanding AI-assisted programming. It truly hits home for a lot of programmers! ['More Details'](https://x.com/wwwgoubuli/status/1940942626473365908)

6.  **Baoyu** shared **Andrew Ng**'s "golden nugget" of advice on how to efficiently develop an **MVP** using **AI**! ✨ Ng points out that when time is tight, you should absolutely **drastically cut down the project scope** until it can be completed quickly. This way, you can swiftly launch, validate ideas, and get feedback pronto. Andrew Ng used his own experience developing a **virtual audience simulator** as a lively example, illustrating how this "**quick start**" approach helps developers beat procrastination, rapidly master new skills, and accelerate product iteration. It's truly a godsend for entrepreneurs! ['More Details'](https://x.com/dotey/status/1940868768948760613)

7.  Responding to dontbesilent's suggestion of "just ask **AI** if you don't understand," **Baoyu** hit the nail on the head regarding why many find it tough to actually do that: it's all about **not knowing how to clearly articulate the problem**! 🎯 He emphasized that in interacting with AI, "**asking questions**" is often more challenging than "answering questions." This profoundly reveals the criticality of **questioning ability** for effective **AI interaction**. Looks like if we want AI to truly lend a hand, we gotta learn how to ask the right questions first! ['More Details'](https://x.com/dotey/status/1940845834373157125)
