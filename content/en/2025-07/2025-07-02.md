7. Baoyu shared an article by Jack Morris that's basically a "wake-up call" for the AI field! 🔔 The article points out that the four major breakthroughs in **Large Language Models (LLMs)** surprisingly weren't due to any new theories, but rather each time, they successfully unearthed and leveraged new **data sources**! 🤯 For example, **ImageNet**, massive amounts of internet text, and human feedback, among others. This article stresses: **data** is the "unsung hero" driving AI's continuous progress! 🦸‍♀️ It even predicts that future AI development will continue to rely on discovering new **data**, such as **YouTube videos** or **embodied data** collected by robots, rather than innovations in models or algorithms. Looks like it's "he who controls the data, controls the world"! 👑
