### **AI Product & Feature Updates**
1. Baidu made a "big move" on June 30th: officially **open-sourcing the Wenxin (ERNIE) 4.5 large model series** 🎉, dropping 10 models and their accompanying training and deployment toolchains all at once! This wave of updates is nothing short of a "power explosion" – especially when it comes to **multimodal understanding**, it's seriously "rock-solid" when handling video 📹✨. What's even cooler is that thanks to the **Heterogeneous Mixture of Experts (MoE)** architecture and various optimization techniques, the deployment barrier has been significantly lowered, so even "newbies" can get their hands on it now! The goal of this open-sourcing effort is to streamline the entire process "from model download to application launch," using "powerful tools" like ERNIEKit and FastDeploy 🚀 to make development and deployment efficiency skyrocket, allowing AI applications to "blossom everywhere," and fostering a more vibrant ecosystem! 💐

### **Cutting-Edge AI Research**
1. Biwei Huang's lab at UC San Diego has rolled out **Causal-Copilot, an autonomous causal analysis agent**, which is practically a "smart guide" for **causal analysis**! 🧙‍♂️ It integrates over 20 advanced **causal analysis algorithms**, specifically designed to tackle those "high-bar" challenges like **causal discovery** and **causal inference**, and it even performed better than **GPT-4o** in tests! 😮 This system can **automate** method selection and parameter tuning, plus it offers **open-source code** and an **online demo** platform, all aimed at accelerating scientific discovery, helping researchers better understand the causal mechanisms between things, and making scientific research a whole lot easier! 🔬

2. The **Meta** research team has come out with some "black tech" again! They've proposed a **rotationally invariant trilinear attention mechanism** (also known as a **2-simplicial Transformer**) that can "see clearly even when circling around" 🔄. This trick aims to optimize the **Scaling Law** for **large language models**, like being able to precisely grasp the "essence" of natural language within a "compressed package" 📦, even with a **limited token budget**! This is practically a godsend for tackling the **pre-training scaling bottleneck** caused by the scarcity of high-quality **tokens**, especially as it can make the efficiency of **large-scale models** "shoot right up" 📈.
