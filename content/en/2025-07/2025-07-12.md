### AI Product and Feature Updates
1. Google **Firebase Studio** 🚀✨ just dropped a massive update, rolling out a super flexible **Agent Mode** (with Ask, Agent, and Agent Auto-run) powered by **Gemini 2.5**. Plus, they're previewing support for the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** and **Gemini CLI** integration. The whole idea is to give developers a seriously autonomous AI-assisted coding and app development experience. These cool new features let you guide AI behavior by defining rule files and even customize AI workflows. They've already nailed it in real-world projects like hydrogen economy platforms, fashion styling systems, Pokémon card management, and architectural design visualization tools.

2. Mafengwo 🗺️🤖✈️ has officially opened up its deeply personalized travel guide creator, "**AI Trip Planner**," to all users. At the same time, its **AI Travel Assistant**, "**AI Xiaoma**," is launching practical features like "**AI Japan Restaurant Booking**," "**Menu Photo Recognition**," and "**Multi-language Real-time Translation**" (supporting 7 languages). The goal here is to give users a fully smart, end-to-end free-and-easy international travel experience, from planning trips to on-the-ground services. The "**AI Trip Planner**" pioneered a "proactive questioning-demand calibration-precise generation" model, while **AI Xiaoma**'s new features can handle restaurant bookings and menu translations (with actual images!) without you having to lift a finger.

### Cutting-Edge AI Research
1. **Tri Dao**, a co-author of **Flash Attention**, teamed up with Princeton University PhD students to drop the **QuACK** kernel library ⚡️🚀. Developed solely with **Python** and **CuTe-DSL**, it pulls off a 33%-50% speed boost on **H100** graphics cards compared to existing PyTorch libraries. This innovation is a big deal in the industry, optimizing **memory-intensive kernel** performance without needing traditional CUDA code. They've even got a detailed tutorial for developers to get started.
    <br/> [![QuACK Kernel Library](https://cdn.jsdmirror.com/gh/justlovemaki/imagehub@main/assets/2025/07/news_01jzx282tdej6rdyg0yv9e1bfz.jpeg)](https://cdn.jsdmirror.com/gh/justlovemaki/imagehub@main/assets/2025/07/news_01jzx282tdej6rdyg0yv9e1bfz.jpeg) <br/>
2. To get a full picture of **foundational visual reasoning** capabilities, researchers rolled out **TreeBench** 🧠📊, a diagnostic benchmark. They found that current models are still struggling with **visual perception** and **second-order reasoning** in complex scenarios. To tackle this, they introduced the **TreeVGR** training paradigm, which significantly boosts performance by combining localization and reasoning through reinforcement learning. This proves that **traceability** is key to pushing this field forward. ['Paper Link'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07999)
3. This study dove into the possibility of achieving **depth-adaptive** architectures in pre-trained **large language models** 🔬🧠📈 by dynamically skipping or repeating layers during testing. The research found that this approach doesn't just supercharge **inference efficiency**; it also improves accuracy for samples that were previously mispredicted, really shining a light on the limitations of fixed model architectures. ['Paper Link'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07996)

### AI Industry Outlook and Social Impact
1. General AI agent company **Manus AI** 🇨🇳➡️🇸🇬🤔 recently shook things up with its **China operations**, including some **layoffs** and relocating **core technical staff** to its **Singapore headquarters**.
