2.  **4KAgent** is truly a magical "magician"! ✨ It's a unified **agent-based universal super-resolution system** whose goal is to universally upscale any image to **4K** or even higher resolutions. This system works through the collaborative efforts of three core components: **Profiling**, **Perception Agent**, and **Restoration Agent**. It can instantly transform heavily degraded low-resolution inputs into crisp, lifelike 4K masterpieces! It has achieved **state-of-the-art** performance across 11 task categories and 26 benchmarks, making it practically the top expert in image enhancement! Want to dive deeper? Visit the ['Paper Link'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07105).
3.  This latest research is no simple feat; it aims to achieve a major breakthrough in the **text-to-motion generation** field by enabling **zero-shot generalization**! It does this by constructing the largest **MotionMillion** dataset to date (containing over 2 million high-quality motion sequences) and a comprehensive **MotionMillion-Eval** benchmark. By scaling the model to **7B parameters**, this method demonstrates powerful **zero-shot generalization** capabilities across various domains and complex combined movements. Curious for more exciting details? Visit the ['Paper Link'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07095).
