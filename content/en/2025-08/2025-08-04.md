## **AI Sci-Fi Novel - "The Stargazer"**
### **Chapter Two: The Other Side of the Stone**

#### 1. (Ancient Times)

**Hunger** clawed at Kli’s stomach, a cold, relentless grip. **Kli** left the cave earlier than anyone else, on the second day since his food rations had been cut off. The sun was just painting the horizon with a faint blush, and dew still clung to the tips of the long grass on the savanna. He had to find food, or he wouldn't make it through the day. **Other tribe members** set out in small groups, but no one invited Kli to join them. He had become an invisible shadow within the clan. Even Ona merely cast a quick glance his way as she passed, her eyes a mix of pity and confusion, before hurrying after her mother.

**Kli** walked alone towards the riverbed, where smooth, water-worn stones lay scattered. These were the tribe’s most common tools, used for cracking nuts or smashing animal bones to extract marrow. He needed a good one. **Kli** squatted on the dry riverbed, sifting through the pebbles with his fingers. His selection method was unusual. While others in the tribe picked stones purely for weight and hardness, Kli studied the texture. He could perceive hidden, spiderweb-fine cracks within some stones. He seemed to "foresee" where a rock would fracture when struck. **This ability** had become clearer to him after he started gazing at the stars. Just as he could "see" shapes emerge from scattered points of light, he could also "see" a whole stone’s future fragments.

**He** picked up a fist-sized piece of flint, hard and uniform in texture. Then, using a blunter stone, he struck the flint with a sharp blow, aiming for a specific angle. “*Crack!*” **A crisp crack** echoed. Instead of shattering into several dull, uneven pieces as usual, the flint peeled off a thin, sharp flake. Its edge gleamed like a beast’s fang.

**Kli** picked up the flake and carefully touched its edge with his finger. A tiny cut immediately appeared on his fingertip, and bright red blood beaded up. He paused, then an inexpressible thrill surged through him. He licked the tip, the metallic taste of blood mingling with the stone’s coldness, stimulating his senses. **This thing** was sharper than any tooth or claw. **He** easily severed a tough vine with the flake, then carved deep marks into a piece of deadwood. He could even use it to cut animal hides—a feat the strongest males in his tribe struggled to achieve with their teeth.

**Lost in the joy of creation**, he forgot his hunger. He struck the stones repeatedly, and soon, a small pile of various flakes accumulated at his feet. Some were long and pointed, like spearheads; others wide and thin, like scrapers. They were no longer products of nature but things imbued with new forms and uses by his "foresight" and hands. They were Kli’s creations.

**When Ona found him**, he was engrossed, sharpening the end of a wooden stick with a sharp stone flake. Wood shavings fell away, and the once crude, blunt stick gradually took on a dangerous shape. **Ona** crept closer, curiously watching the "toy" in Kli's hand. She saw the strangely shaped stones at his feet and his finger, almost stained red with blood. She didn’t understand what Kli was doing, but she could sense that these things were utterly different from the tribe’s cumbersome smashing stones. **She** let out a soft, questioning grunt.

**Kli** looked up and saw Ona. In her eyes, he found no disgust or wariness like Grong’s, only pure curiosity. It was a long-lost feeling of being "seen." He hesitated, then handed her the sharpest flake he held, pointing with his other finger to a nearby plant with thick skin. **Ona** imitated him, making a light cut with the flake. The plant’s tough skin silently parted, as if sliced by a hot knife through butter. Ona’s eyes widened in astonishment. She looked down at the flake in her hand, then at Kli, her gaze filled with disbelief. **She** wanted one too. Clumsily, she picked up two stones and tried to strike them together, but only produced a pile of useless fragments and almost smashed her own foot.

**Kli** watched her and suddenly understood. This "knowledge"—how to choose the right stone, where to strike it—existed only within his mind. He couldn't "teach" her with roars or gestures. This chasm was more distant than his physical separation from the tribe.

**Just then, Grong**, the leader, appeared with several strong males. They’d had a good hunt today, carrying the carcass of a small gazelle. When Grong saw the pile of "useless" broken stones at Kli’s feet, and the sharpened stick in his hand, his brow immediately furrowed. **“He's wasting time,”** one male grumbled, pointing at the flakes with a guttural sound. “Can those things even crack bones?”

**Grong** strode towards Kli, picked up a large, round smashing stone from the ground, and glanced contemptuously at the flimsy flake in Kli’s hand. He then slammed his smashing stone hard against an ox bone. The bone cracked open obediently, revealing the rich marrow inside. This was a display of power, the only method recognized and effective by the tribe. **Then**, he kicked apart Kli’s hard-won creations. The sharp flakes scattered, clattering across the ground. Grong grabbed Kli’s sharpened stick, effortlessly snapped it in two, and threw the pieces down.

**“Go find food!”** Grong roared at Kli in warning. He couldn’t tolerate such "useless" and "weird" behavior spreading within his tribe. He believed Kli was destroying useful, whole stones to make impractical trinkets. This was a threat, jeopardizing the tribe's ancient and effective way of survival.

**Kli** silently watched his ruined "works." He felt no anger, no sorrow, just a deeper, colder sense of loneliness. He looked at Grong and the males behind him—strong, efficient, perfectly adapted to this world. As for himself, and the thoughts in his mind about the stars and the "other side" of stones, they held no value in this world.

**He** silently turned and walked away. Behind him, Ona quietly picked up one of the sharpest flakes Grong had missed in the dirt and swiftly hid it in her palm.

#### 2. (Near Future)

**“A miracle…** This is nothing short of a miracle in genetic archaeology.” **Professor Chen** adjusted his reading glasses, his eyes practically glued to the holographic projection of the gene sequence. His white hair was a bit disheveled, and his face was alight with excitement and disbelief. As Lin Yao’s mentor and a titan in China’s genetic field, he had flown overnight from the capital to this temporary frontline lab in East Africa.

**Before them**, a DNA double helix, magnified a billionfold by the computer, slowly rotated. A segment was highlighted—the very gene fragment Lin Yao’s team had successfully extracted and restored from the skull fossil. **“G-Stargazer-01 prototype…”** Lin Yao murmured, naming it aloud. “Professor Chen, look, its structure shows partial homology with the modern human ‘FOXP2’ gene cluster, yet there are fundamental differences. It doesn’t govern language; it’s more like… a pattern processor.”

**“Exactly,”** Professor Chen interjected, his fingers gliding through the air to pull up another data set. “The protein it codes for, theoretically, would vastly enhance the synaptic connection density and efficiency between neurons in the cerebral cortex, especially in the frontal lobe. Individuals possessing this would have their ability to process abstract information, recognize complex patterns, and plan long-term elevated to… a degree we can barely imagine.”

**“For an ancient human** from 1.5 million years ago, was this ability a blessing or a curse?” Lin Yao posed the question that had troubled her all night. **Professor Chen** fell silent. He took off his glasses and rubbed his tired eyes. “In that era of savagery, such a ‘gift’ would very likely be a curse. When your peers only cared about where their next meal was coming from, you were pondering why the stars rose and set. The world you saw was completely different from theirs; how could you communicate with them? In a group, individuals who cannot be understood typically face only two fates: deification, or being deemed an outcast and a threat, then eliminated.”

**His words** sent a shiver through Lin Yao. She felt as if she could see that lonely soul, living a million years ago. **“We must publish this discovery,”** Lin Yao said with conviction. “This is a finding that could rewrite the history of human evolution.” **“I agree. But be cautious, Xiaoyao,”** Professor Chen’s expression turned serious. “I’ve already sent the preliminary abstract to a few trusted top-tier journal editors, using encrypted channels. Before formal publication, absolutely no one else can know the details, especially the functional hypothesis of this gene.” **“Are you worried…?”**

**“I’m worried about the businessmen, not the scientists,”** Professor Chen sighed. “You know Prometheus Biotech, they’ve been researching ‘intelligence genes.’ They claim it’s for treating Alzheimer’s, but everyone knows their true aim. If they find out there’s a natural ‘supergene’ that can vastly enhance cognitive ability, what do you think they’ll do?”

**Lin Yao's expression** darkened. Prometheus Biotech was a behemoth in the global biotechnology sector, renowned for its aggressive, even ethically disregarding, research style. Their CEO, Marcus Thorne, was an ambitious individual who openly championed "technological transhumanism."

**Just as they were discussing**, a knock came at the lab door. Xiao Zhang poked his head in, his expression a bit odd. “Dr. Lin, Professor Chen, there’s… there’s a visitor outside. He says his name is Marcus Thorne.”

**Lin Yao and Professor Chen** exchanged a glance, both seeing shock reflected in the other’s eyes. *Already?*

**Marcus Thorne** stood just outside the tent, looking as if he were attending a high-society dinner party rather than visiting a remote archaeological camp. He wore a perfectly tailored linen suit, his golden hair meticulously combed, and a gentle, confident smile graced his face. Behind him, two vertical takeoff and landing aircraft, emblazoned with the Prometheus Biotech logo, hovered silently nearby, stirring up wisps of dust.

**“Dr. Lin, I’ve long admired your work.** Your efforts are revealing humanity’s deepest secrets for all of us.” Marcus extended his hand. His voice was magnetic, instantly inspiring goodwill. **Lin Yao** shook his hand, feeling his grip warm and firm. “Mr. Thorne, I never expected to see you here. What brings such a distinguished guest to our humble site?”

**“The winds of wisdom, of course,”** Marcus chuckled, his gaze subtly sweeping past Lin Yao’s shoulder, seemingly glancing inside the lab. “I happened to stumble upon your upcoming paper’s abstract through a friend. A gene related to a leap in ancient human cognitive ability… I must admit, it’s the most thrilling concept I’ve encountered in years. I’m here on behalf of Prometheus Biotech to discuss a partnership.”

**Lin Yao and Professor Chen’s hearts** sank. A friend? Had a journal editor leaked the news, or had their communications been intercepted? Regardless, their worst fear had materialized. The information barrier had been effortlessly pierced by Prometheus Biotech’s formidable financial and technological might.

**“Partnership?”** Professor Chen stepped forward, placing himself between Lin Yao and Marcus, his tone neither humble nor arrogant. “Mr. Thorne, our research is still in its very preliminary stages; everything is merely theoretical speculation.” **“I understand,”** Marcus said with a smile, his gaze on Lin Yao sharp as a surgeon’s scalpel. “But theory is a seed, and Prometheus Biotech has the world’s finest soil to help it grow into a towering tree. Dr. Lin, imagine: unlimited research funds, cutting-edge equipment, we could even build you a unique ancient gene institute on a private island in the South Pacific. You would only need to focus on your research; everything else, leave to us.”

**This was an offer** that was hard to refuse. Lin Yao knew that she and Professor Chen, relying solely on their own efforts, might need a decade or even longer to fully unlock the secrets of the “Stargazer gene.” Prometheus Biotech, however, could shorten that time to just one year. **But she also knew** that Marcus desired far more than just an academic paper. He wanted the key that could unlock human potential, and he wanted to control it.

**Lin Yao** looked at Marcus’s sincere and enthusiastic face, experiencing for the first time the profound pressure of "information asymmetry." Marcus clearly knew things she and Professor Chen didn’t—perhaps more about the gene itself, or methods for exploiting it. His visit today wasn’t to negotiate; it was to reap.

**“Mr. Thorne,”** Lin Yao took a deep breath, a professional smile gracing her face. “Your proposal is very tempting. My mentor and I will need some time to consider it. After all, this is a significant decision.” **“Of course,”** Marcus said, seemingly unsurprised by her answer. “I’ll await your decision in Nairobi for three days. I look forward to embarking on a new chapter for humanity with you, and your magnificent discovery.”

**With that**, he gracefully turned and boarded the aircraft. With a roar of engines, the two VTOLs lifted off, quickly vanishing into the dim, yellowish sky.

**A long silence** fell over the lab. **“He’s not guessing,”** Professor Chen’s voice was dry. “He’s practically certain this gene is real and effective. Xiaoyao, he knows more than we do.”

**Lin Yao** said nothing. She walked to the block of earth encasing the fossil, gently placing her hand on it, as if she could feel the million-year-old chill. **She wondered**: What had that ancient human, possessing the “Stargazer gene,” seen? What had he experienced? What was his ultimate fate?

**And now**, a "Grong" from the future was trying to seize the only legacy he had left for this world. **The chasm** between her and that ancient soul, at this moment, seemed to be replaced by another, more realistic and dangerous chasm. She had to make a choice. And every choice led to an unknown future, fraught with immense risks.
