### Product and Feature Updates

1.  Kling AI, a Kuaishou subsidiary, just dropped its new digital human feature, **AI Avatar**! All you gotta do is upload a photo and an audio clip, and boom—you can drive a virtual character with text commands, giving it tons of expressions and emotions. This "soul injection" tech instantly transforms static images into lively videos, unlocking endless possibilities for content creation. Right now, this feature is in limited beta, so [Head to the Official Social Media (AI News)](https://x.com/Kling_ai/status/1966129216296251515), comment and retweet to snag an "early bird ticket" to digital life! ✨

2.  Claude API just bagged a super cool new skill: **"Web Fetch"**! Now, it can directly dive in and "snag" web pages and PDF content itself, so developers can ditch building their own elaborate setups. This feature lets Claude seamlessly link up with web search, powering through everything from finding info to deep-diving analysis. Whether you're ripping through documents, doing research, or handling user links, it's an absolute breeze. This bad boy is now in public beta. Devs who are keen can [Check out the Documentation (AI News)](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/web-fetch-tool) and get started ASAP, giving your app instant web analysis superpowers! 🚀

3.  ChatGPT, though a bit late to the party, is finally all-in on supporting **MCP (My ChatGPT) tool write operations** in developer mode! 🎉 This is huge news, meaning developers can now whip up connectors that let ChatGPT directly perform "write actions" like updating Jira or firing off Zapier workflows. No more just sticking to simple searches and fetches! This update dramatically expands ChatGPT's automation game, propelling it beyond a mere "chatbot" and transforming it into a bona fide [Smart Workflow Hub (AI News)](https://x.com/aiwarts/status/1965940519634350499).

### Frontier Research

1.  Volcano Engine Multimedia Lab just dropped a tech-bomb: **LiveGS**! This bad boy has successfully dragged mobile free-viewpoint video live streaming out of sci-fi and into reality, even scoring a prestigious spot at the top graphics conference, **SIGGRAPH**! 💥 How'd they do it? Through three game-changing innovations: real-time reconstruction via feedforward neural networks, lossless compression up to a whopping 500 times, and a rendering strategy totally optimized for phones. This trifecta completely smashes the compute and bandwidth bottlenecks that plagued mobile FVV. What's it mean for you? Well, in the future, whether you're catching a soccer match or a virtual idol concert, you'll be able to freely switch to a "god's-eye view" right on your phone.

2.  Amazon AWS researchers are turning large models into bona fide **"white-hat hackers"**! Through their two killer projects, **Cyber-Zero** and **CTF-Dojo**, they're teaching AI to sniff out and fix security vulnerabilities in both virtual and real-world scenarios. Cyber-Zero is super innovative, pulling off "runtime-free training" by simulating attacks and defenses in a purely text-based environment to safely and efficiently churn out training data. Meanwhile, CTF-Dojo sets up actual "Capture The Flag arenas" for models to sharpen their skills in practical combat. This powerful one-two punch isn't just paving the way for the rise of [AI Security Agents (AI News)](https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2025-09-11-2); it's also sparking some deep thoughts about the dual-use nature of this tech. 🤔<br/>![AI News: CTF-Dojo System Architecture](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/09/news_01k4wtcw95ec4966cjt85nfs8d.avif)

3.  Ever wondered how to get large models to work efficiently "blindfolded" on encrypted data? Well, a new paper just dropped, introducing a clever algorithm called **cutmax** that totally solves this tricky privacy computing puzzle! 🤯 This groundbreaking research is the first to nail efficient argmax and top-p sampling under **Homomorphic Encryption (HE)**. What's that mean? Models can now do inference and generate text without ever decrypting user data. Experiments show this fresh approach slashes inference latency by a whopping 24 to 35 times, truly paving the way for [Secure and Private AI Applications (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08383) and marking a massive leap in privacy computing! 🚀

4.  How tough is it to find stuff in the murky underwater world? 🌊 A recent review paper dives deep, systematically mapping out the five major challenges facing **Underwater Object Detection (UOD)**, and it's got its eyes set on powerful **Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)**. The paper doesn't just look back at solutions from old-school image processing to modern AI; it also boldly tried using DALL-E 3 to cook up synthetic data and then fine-tuned the Florence-2 model for underwater detection. The research spills the tea: while LVLMs have massive potential, we've still got a long, long way to go to get them to perform [Real-time "Eagle Eye" Object Detection Underwater (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08490), especially when it comes to optimizing models and real-time applications. 🐠
